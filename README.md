## Problem 1

In this problem, we compare two types of metrics to train a GAN discriminator. The code for problem 1 can be found in "problem_1.py". You will need pytorch 1.0 or later to run it.

Parameters are :
- --metric ("JSD" or "WD") : What metric will be used for training among Wasserstein distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence
- --use_cuda ("True" or "False")
- --setup ("3" or "4") : The two experiments that were required in problem 1
